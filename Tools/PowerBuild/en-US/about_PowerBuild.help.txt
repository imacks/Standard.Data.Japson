SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PowerBuild is a source code build system based on PowerShell.

INSTALLATION
    The best option is to use the installer. If you are a savy scripter, try the headless options.

    # Using the installer

    1. IMPORTANT! ** DO NOT ** click on Install.cmd in the archive.

    2. Delete the PowerExtend installation folder if you already have a previous copy installed.

    3. Extract Install.cmd to a local path. Path cannot have spaces and must be accessible to the administrators group. Same goes for the path to this zip package.

    4. Double click on the extracted Install.cmd

    5. Follow instructions.

    ---------------------

    YOUR WORK IS DONE. STOP READING. THE REST IS FOR SCRIPTING GURUS

    # Headless install

    1. Install.cmd C:\Full\Path\To\PowerBuild.zip

    2. Your terminal needs to be running in escalated mode in order to avoid the UAC prompt.


    # Portable app

    1. If you have installed PowerPackman, use the command 'Install-PortableApp'.

    2. Install-PortableApp -Source PowerBuild.zip -Profile 'Install-AllUser'


    # Manual installation

    If the installer didn't work out, you can also try a manual installation.

    1. Copy the 'PowerBuild' folder in archive to Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules.
    So you get 'Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PowerBuild\PowerBuild.psd1', ...

    2. WIN+Run PowerShell, then in an escalated terminal, type in: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

    3. To see a list of available commands: Get-Command -Module PowerBuild
